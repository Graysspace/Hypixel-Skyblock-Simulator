    <h1>Hypixel Skyblock Simulator</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>The goal of this Simulator is to reach 100 million coins.</h2>
    <p>Use areas such as the village, Nether, and End to reach this goal. 
        Money is collected in your purse and can be transfered to the bank.
    Make sure to bank regularly as dying will remove half the coins collected in your purse!</p>
